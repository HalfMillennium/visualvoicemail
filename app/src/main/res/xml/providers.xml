    <!--
        This file is used to specify providers that we know default settings for
        so that the user can set up their account by simply entering their email
        address and password.

        When a user starts this process, the email address is parsed, the domain
        broken out and used to search this file for a provider. If one is found the
        provider's settings are used to attempt to connect to the account.
        
        At this time, the id and label attributes are not used.  However, please include them
        if you make edits to this file.  id must also be completely unique.  label will be shown
        to the user when there are multiple options provided for a single domain (not currently
        supported).

        A provider contains the settings for setting up an email account
        that ends with the given domain. Domains should be unique within
        this file. Each provider should have at least one incoming section and
        one outgoing section. If more than one is specified only the first
        will be used.

        Valid incoming uri schemes are:
            imap+tls+   IMAP with required TLS transport security.
                            If TLS is not available the connection fails.
            imap+ssl+   IMAP with required SSL transport security.
                            If SSL is not available the connection fails.

            pop3+tls+   POP3 with required TLS transport security.
                            If TLS is not available the connection fails.
            pop3+ssl+   POP3 with required SSL transport security.
                            If SSL is not available the connection fails.

        Valid outgoing uri schemes are:
            smtp+tls+   SMTP with required TLS transport security.
                            If TLS is not available the connection fails.
            smtp+ssl+   SMTP with required SSL transport security.
                            If SSL is not available the connection fails.

        The URIs should be full templates for connection, including a port if
        the service uses a non-default port.  The default ports are as follows:
            imap+tls+   143     pop3+tls+   110     smtp+tls+   587
            imap+ssl+   993     pop3+ssl+   995     smtp+ssl+   465

        The username attribute is used to supply a template for the username
        that will be presented to the server. This username is built from a
        set of variables that are substituted with parts of the user
        specified email address.

        Valid substitution values for the username attribute are:
            $email - the email address the user entered
            $user - the value before the @ sign in the email address the user entered
            $domain - the value after the @ sign in the email address the user entered
            
        The username attribute MUST be specified for the incoming element, so the POP3 or IMAP
        server can identify the mailbox to be opened.
        
        The username attribute MAY be the empty string for the outgoing element, but only if the 
        SMTP server supports anonymous transmission (most don't).

        While it would technically work please DO NOT add providers that don't support encrypted
        connections.
